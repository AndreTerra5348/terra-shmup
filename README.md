# Terra Shmup

This will be a simple shoot'em up game made with [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/).


# How to develop

The easiest way to develop is to use the [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) feature. This will allow you to develop directly in the browser.
You can use [VScode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to develop locally.
Or you can install the dependencies locally and run the project with `npm install` and `npm run start`.
